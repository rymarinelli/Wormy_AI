# Wormy_AI 🐛

**Wormy_AI** is a companion research repository for the project  
**“Responsible Development of Offensive AI.”**

It contains a **Google Colab / Jupyter notebook** and supporting Python modules used to perform **post-hoc analysis and interpretability studies** on large language model (LLM) workflows, including embedding behavior, activation structure, and prompt-propagation effects.

This repository focuses exclusively on **analysis and evaluation**, not the implementation or deployment of offensive techniques.

## Upstream Dependency

Wormy_AI is designed to operate on artifacts generated by the upstream project:

**ComPromptMized**  
https://github.com/StavC/ComPromptMized

The ComPromptMized repository is expected to be installed locally, as Wormy_AI performs **additional analysis on its data, logs, and workflow outputs**.
